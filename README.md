# Java-Projects

Welcome to my Java projects repository! This repository showcases multiple Java projects, each demonstrating different programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving. Each project is organized into its own folder, with a dedicated README file providing additional details about its objectives, setup, and usage.

## Project Folders Overview

### 1. [Building Project](./Building)

- **Description:** Models buildings, apartments, and Canadian addresses using object-oriented principles such as inheritance and encapsulation.
- **Main Classes:** `Building`, `Apartment`, `CanadianAddress`
- **Folder Path:** `/Building/`
- [Link to Building README](./Building/README.md)

### 2. [Circle Class](./Circle%20Class//)

- **Description:** A Java program that models circles and performs geometric calculations, such as area, perimeter, and point containment. It also includes functionality to check if one circle is contained within another.
- **Main Classes:** `CircleClass`
- **Folder Path:** `/CircleClass/`
- [Link to Circle Class README](./Circle%20Class//README.md)

### 3. [Image Processing](./ImageProcessing/)

- **Description:** A Java application for basic image manipulation tasks, such as cropping, mirroring (horizontal and vertical), and converting images to greyscale. It uses the `BufferedImage` class for image processing and `JFrame` for displaying images.
- **Main Classes:** `ImageProcessing`
- **Folder Path:** `/ImageProcessing/`
- [Link to Image Processing README](./ImageProcessing//README.md)

### 4. [Matrix Operations](./MatrixOperations)

- **Description:** Provides operations on matrices, including addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
- **Main Classes:** `MyMatrixOperator`, `MyMatrixDriver`
- **Folder Path:** `/MatrixOperations/`
- [Link to Matrix Operations README](./MatrixOperations/README.md)

### 5. [Stacks and Queues](./StackQueues)

- **Description:** Implements stack and queue data structures to manage `Student` objects.
- **Main Classes:** `Student`, `MyStack`, `MyQueue`
- **Folder Path:** `/StackQueues/`
- [Link to Stacks and Queues README](./StackQueues/README.md)
