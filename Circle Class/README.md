# Circle Class Project

This project is a Java-based implementation of a Circle class, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, method overriding, and object interactions. The project includes classes for managing points and circles, along with test drivers to demonstrate their functionality.

## Features

- **Circle Class (`Circle.java`)**:
  - Stores a center point and radius.
  - Computes area and perimeter.
  - Checks if a point is inside the circle.
  - Checks if another circle is completely inside it.

- **Point Class (`Point.java`)**:
  - Represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates.
  - Computes distance between two points.
  - Supports setting and getting coordinates.

- **Test Drivers**:
  - `CircleDriver.java`: Demonstrates circle functionalities, including area, perimeter, and containment.
  - `PointDriver.java`: Demonstrates point functionalities and distance calculation.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Java installed**
   - Requires Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later).
   - Check Java version with:
     ```sh
     java -version
     ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```sh
   cd CircleClass
   ```

3. **Compile the Java files**
   If your files are inside a `src` folder, navigate into it:
   ```sh
   cd src
   ```
   Then compile all Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```

4. **Run the test classes**
   - To test the `Circle` class:
     ```sh
     java CircleDriver
     ```
   - To test the `Point` class:
     ```sh
     java PointDriver
     ```

## Code Structure

- **Circle.java**: Defines the `Circle` class and its functionalities.
- **Point.java**: Defines the `Point` class and provides distance calculations.
- **CircleDriver.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the `Circle` class.
- **PointDriver.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the `Point` class.
